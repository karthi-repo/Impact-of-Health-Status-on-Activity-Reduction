As health status directly influences an individual's ability to engage in daily activities, understanding this relationship can aid in improving healthcare interventions and personalized care. This project aims to explore how various health factors—such as chronic illnesses, age, and mental health—affect activity levels across different demographic groups. By leveraging a heat map chart, we can visually represent the correlation between different health conditions and the reduction in physical or social activity. The heat map will enable healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers to identify patterns in activity reduction based on specific health conditions, helping them design targeted interventions for improving the overall well-being of individuals. This analysis can provide insights into how to enhance the quality of life for patients by addressing factors that lead to reduced activity levels.
